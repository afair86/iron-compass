## The Three Levers

- Burn: stop leaks, reset lifestyle creep.
- Income: one focused offer or skill that pays inside 90 days.
- Automation: route cash to defense and offense before spending.

## Week 0 Baseline

- Trail 3-month burn; runway in months.
- Savings rate; debt APR list.
- Defense target (3–6 months essentials); offense percentage for investing/bets.

## Weeks 1–4: Cut Burn & Fund Defense

- Eliminate or downgrade subscriptions; renegotiate big rocks (rent, insurance, phone).
- Pause discretionary until defense bucket hits target.
- Guardrails: if defense &lt;3 months, no new offense bets; route windfalls to defense first.

## Weeks 5–8: Income Stack

- Pick one offer (consulting, micro-service) or one upskill tied to a paying project.
- Daily: 60–90 minutes on offer build/outreach; 3–5 outreaches/day.
- Track: responses, calls booked, revenue; adjust one lever weekly (offer, channel, volume).

## Weeks 9–12: Automate & Rebalance

- Auto-transfer on payday: defense, then offense; spend what remains.
- Bets sleeve 5–15% max, only after defense is full.
- Monthly rebalance: if defense dips, pause offense growth and refill defense.

## Scoreboard & Reviews

- Weekly 20 minutes: burn delta, savings rate, revenue this week, next outreach block.
- Monthly: runway months, bets percentage, upcoming big bills; adjust guardrails if needed.

## Putting It Into Play

- Use a single bank hub with labeled sub-accounts.
- Calendar money blocks; outreach happens first, not last.
- Celebrate weeks, not windfalls; rerun the sprint quarterly.

## FAQ

**How much should I hold in defense?** Three months minimum; six if income is volatile. Rebuild defense before expanding offense.

**Can I invest before defense is full?** No—fill defense first, then offense and small bets. If defense dips, refill before new bets.

**What if income is flat after four weeks?** Change one lever: offer, channel, or daily outreach volume; increase reps before switching lanes.
