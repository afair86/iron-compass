## Why Runway Shrinks Faster Than You Expect

Expense creep, irregular income, and slow decisions quietly kill runway. Treat your life like a lean operation: map cash, tighten burn, and add reliable inflows.

## The 12-Week Runway Plan

- **Week 1:** Audit cash; set targets; pick side-income lane.
- **Weeks 2–4:** Implement cuts; launch quick revenue wins.
- **Weeks 5–8:** Stabilize inflows; automate saving/investing.
- **Weeks 9–12:** Optimize pricing/scope; build a simple buffer and risk checks.

## Step 1: Map Cash and Burn

- List all fixed/variable expenses; tag must-keep vs cut/replace.
- Calculate burn rate and runway (cash / monthly burn).
- Set a 12-week target: +X weeks of runway or +$Y buffer.

## Step 2: Cut and Shift Fast

- Replace recurring tools; cancel low-utility subscriptions.
- Negotiate rates (insurance, internet, phone); move to annual where cheaper.
- Drop nonessential discretionary for 12 weeks—treat it as a sprint.

## Step 3: Add Revenue Micro-Wins

- **Services:** productized offer (fixed scope/price); pre-sell slots.
- **Consulting calls:** paid audits/assessments with a clear deliverable.
- **Skill sprints:** packaged outcomes (setup, migration, optimization) 7–14 day delivery.
- Set a weekly outbound target (e.g., 20 quality reaches) and a conversion goal.

## Step 4: Automate the Basics

- Auto-transfer to savings/brokerage on payday; pay yourself first.
- Create sinking funds for known expenses (tax, insurance, car).
- Use separate accounts: income, operating, buffer.

## Step 5: Price and Scope Correctly

- Offer tiered options (good/better/best) with clear outcomes, not hours.
- Set revision limits and delivery timelines; collect deposits upfront.
- Raise prices on legacy clients after proving value; give notice and options.

## Step 6: Risk Controls

- Keep one card for recurring, one for variable; review statements weekly.
- If income is variable, hold 1–2 months of expenses as a buffer before ramping investments.
- Avoid new debt during the sprint; if needed, keep it small and time-bound.

## Metrics to Track Weekly

- Burn vs target; runway weeks; cash buffer size; revenue booked/collected.
- Outbound sent, calls booked, close rate; average deal size; delivery cycle time.

## Templates and Scripts

- **Audit ask:** “What can I remove/replace this week that I won’t miss?”
- **Offer pitch:** “I help [who] get [outcome] in [time] for [price], with [scope]. Want the slot?”
- **Price increase:** “We’re adjusting to [new rate] on [date]. You’ll receive [added value/clarity]. Options: [tiers].”

## End-of-Week Review (20 Minutes)

- What cut landed? What revenue hit? Where did time leak?
- One change for next week: pricing, outbound volume, offer clarity, or expense removal.

## Putting It in Motion Today

- Run the audit; cancel/replace two items.
- Define one productized offer; message five prospects today.
- Set auto-transfer to buffer; tag all expenses.
