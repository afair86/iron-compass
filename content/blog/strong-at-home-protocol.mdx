## Why Train at Home

Time and logistics kill consistency. A minimalist plan with clear progressions removes excuses: push/hinge/carry, smart conditioning, and recovery habits that keep you durable.

## Equipment Checklist

- 1–2 dumbbells or a kettlebell
- Bands (light/medium/heavy)
- Floor space and a chair/bench
- Optional: pull-up bar, timer, weighted backpack

## Training Template (3–4 Days/Week)

- **Day A:** Push + hinge + carry + short conditioning
- **Day B:** Squat/lunge + pull + core + conditioning
- **Day C:** Mixed upper/lower + carries + conditioning
- **Day D (optional):** Conditioning-only (Zone 2 + short intervals)

## Progression Model (Volume → Load → Density)

- Weeks 1–4: 3–4x8–12, RPE 6–7, rest 90s–2m
- Weeks 5–8: 4–5x6–10, RPE 7–8, rest 90s–2m
- Weeks 9–12: 3–4x5–8, RPE 7–8, add tempo or pauses; rest 75–120s
- Conditioning: 8–15 minutes post-lift; keep breathing nasal/easy for Zone 2, short 10–20s efforts for intervals with long rest

## Sample Week (3 Days)

- **Day A:** Push-ups or DB press; DB/RDL; suitcase carry; 10 min bike/walk intervals
- **Day B:** Split squat; band/pull-up or row; plank/anti-rotation; 12 min Zone 2 walk
- **Day C:** Single-leg RDL; floor press or dips; row; farmer carry; 10 min mixed intervals

## Density and Tempo Tweaks

- If load is light, slow the lowering (3–4s) or add pauses at the bottom.
- Reduce rest by 10–15s weekly if form holds.
- Add a set only after reps/tempo/rest are solid.

## Conditioning Tracks

- **Zone 2:** 20–30 minutes walking with a weighted pack or brisk pace; 1–2x/week.
- **Intervals:** 10–15 minutes total; 10–20s work / 60–90s rest; sled/bike/run/step.

## Recovery Stack

- Sleep 7–9 hours; lights-out routine.
- Protein at bodyweight (g) ±10%; hydrate, especially if sweating.
- Walk daily 10–20 minutes for blood flow.

## Travel or Chaotic Weeks

- Run two condensed sessions: 3x10 per pattern (push, hinge, squat, pull, carry), RPE 7.
- Keep Zone 2 walks; skip intervals if sleep is poor.

## Metrics to Track

- Sessions per week; top set RPE; rest times; Zone 2 minutes; sleep hours.
- If sleep &lt;6.5h for 2 nights, hold load and reduce intervals for 72 hours.

## Putting It Into Play

- Pick 3 training days; schedule them like meetings.
- Prep gear the night before; keep a single-page plan visible.
- Review weekly: add load or reduce rest if form and sleep are solid.

## FAQ

**How many days per week?** Three solid sessions; optional fourth for conditioning if you’re sleeping well.

**How do I progress with light weights?** Add tempo, pauses, extra reps, then shorten rest; add load last.

**What if I have only bands?** Use higher reps and slow tempos; double sets on large patterns (squat/hinge/pull/push).
