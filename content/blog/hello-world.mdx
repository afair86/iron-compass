This is your first MDX blog post for Iron Compass. You can write Markdown, embed React components, and use frontmatter for SEO and metadata.


## What This Journal Is

The Iron Compass Journal is a working logbook: no fluff, just field-tested moves for disciplined men. Each dispatch ties back to the core domains—strength & health, discipline & mindset, purpose & direction, leadership & character, financial power, AI mastery, grief & honour, and identity & legacy.

## Who It’s For

- Men who want clear standards, not vague inspiration
- Builders who prefer structure, reps, and measurable progress
- Fathers, founders, and leaders who must stay composed under pressure

## How to Use It Each Week

1. Pick one article that solves a problem you actually have.
2. Run the “moves” section for seven days—no improvisation, no new ideas.
3. Track two numbers only: compliance (yes/no) and energy (1-5). Adjust after a week.

## What to Read Next

- Start the system: [Iron Compass Start Guide](/start)
- Map the territory: [All Domains](/domains)
- Fix the most common failure: [Why Most Men Fail at Discipline](/blog/why-most-men-fail-at-discipline)

## Promise

Every article is designed to be actionable the same day you read it. If a dispatch doesn’t help you make a decision, set a standard, or run a better day—tell us. The journal improves with your feedback.
