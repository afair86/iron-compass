## Why Purpose Gets Foggy

Purpose collapses when horizons are too long and feedback is too slow. Without a short window and visible proof, work drifts. The antidote is a 90-day win, daily proof, and weekly calibration.

## Define the 90-Day Win

- One outcome, one metric, one audience (e.g., launch a cohort with 15 paid seats).
- Constraints: max 4h/day, no new platforms, budget cap.
- Anti-goals: what you will not do (no new side projects, no random courses).

## Weekly Operating Rhythm

- **Sunday Plan (30m):** choose three weekly outcomes, schedule deep blocks.
- **Daily:** 90-minute deep block before comms; one health block; one relationship touch.
- **Friday Review (20m):** score outcomes, pick one adjustment (time, skill, environment).

## Daily Proof System

- Single capture; process once/day.
- Three wins: main task, health, relationship.
- End-of-day micro-journal: what worked; what changes tomorrow.

## Feedback & Calibration

- Two external signals weekly: advisor/peer check-in and user/customer touch.
- Pivot rule: if the main metric is flat for two weeks, change one lever—offer, channel, or time block.

## After 90 Days

- Retrospective: what moved the metric, what blocked it, what repeats.
- Decide the next 90-day win: keep, double, or switch lanes.

## Putting It Into Play

- Calendar deep blocks first; protect mornings for output.
- Use visible scoreboards: outcomes hit, hours on main thing, sleep.
- Remove tool sprawl: one doc, one task list, one calendar.

## FAQ

**What if I can’t pick an outcome?** Choose the smallest credible win with a clear audience; shipping beats pondering.

**How do I stay consistent?** Calendar deep blocks first, review weekly, and adjust only one lever at a time.

**What if life blows up?** Run a 72-hour reset: sleep 8h, one deep block/day, one walk/day, then resume.
