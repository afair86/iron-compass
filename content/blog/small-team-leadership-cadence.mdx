## Why Cadence Matters

Small teams win with focus and speed, but drift when priorities are fuzzy. A light, repeatable cadence keeps direction clear, removes blockers fast, and builds trust without meeting sprawl.

## Weekly Rhythm at a Glance

- **Weekly Kickoff (30–45 min):** Align on 3–5 priorities, owners, and definitions of done.
- **Daily Check (10–15 min):** Progress, blockers, decisions; no solving in the meeting.
- **Midweek Pulse (20–30 min):** Resolve blockers, rebalance capacity, confirm priorities still hold.
- **1:1s (25–40 min):** Growth, feedback, and support; never status-only.
- **Weekly Review (30–45 min):** Score outcomes, document lessons, reset priorities.

## Meeting Playbooks

- **Kickoff:** Review last week’s scores; set this week’s outcomes; clarify dependencies; confirm measures of done.
- **Daily:** Each person: yesterday, today, blocker; capture decisions; keep it short.
- **Pulse:** Triage blockers; trade priorities if needed; confirm top 3 stays the top 3.
- **1:1s:** Feedback both ways, development actions, and resource requests; status belongs in shared docs.
- **Review:** Score outcomes, celebrate wins, note misses, and write one improvement for next week.

## Artifacts to Keep

- Single source of truth: brief weekly doc with priorities, owners, definitions of done.
- Decision log: bullets with date/owner/rationale; prevents re-litigating.
- Risk list: top 3 risks with owners and check-in dates.

## Communication Rules

- Default async updates in the doc; meetings only for decisions or unblockers.
- Owners speak first; avoid manager monologues.
- If a topic needs >5 minutes, park it for a separate session.

## Capacity and Focus

- Limit active priorities to 3–5; finish before adding.
- Track capacity weekly: absences, hiring, major launches.
- Protect 2–3 deep work blocks per person; defend the calendar.

## Trust and Feedback

- Weekly micro-feedback: one thing to keep, one to improve.
- Leaders model vulnerability: share a miss and the fix.
- Publicly credit wins; privately coach misses.

## Metrics to Watch

- Outcome hit rate, blocker resolution time, decision latency, deep work hours protected, attrition signals.

## FAQ

**How do we avoid meeting creep?** Keep one weekly doc, strict agendas, and move problem-solving to separate, time-boxed sessions.

**What if priorities change midweek?** Use the pulse to swap priorities intentionally; communicate changes in the doc.

**How do I build trust fast?** Keep promises small and visible, share quick feedback weekly, and celebrate team wins publicly.
