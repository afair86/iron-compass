## Why You Need an Anchor

Most men try to overhaul everything at once. They burn out, miss a day, and spiral. A daily anchor is one short, non-negotiable block that proves you can keep a promise to yourself. When chaos hits, the anchor holds.

## The 20-Minute Anchor Stack

- **5 minutes:** Breath + posture reset (box breathing, shoulders back)
- **10 minutes:** Focused reps on a single skill (writing, sales outreach, code, study)
- **5 minutes:** Quick review—what improved, what to adjust tomorrow

Do it at the same time each day. If you miss the slot, run it before sleep. No zero days.

## Rules That Make It Stick

- Same location and trigger (desk after coffee, or car before commute)
- No phone within reach; timer on a watch or physical timer
- Track a simple **yes/no** for completion
- If you miss twice, shorten to 10 minutes for three days, then return to 20

## Extend the Anchor

Once the anchor is automatic for 21 days, bolt one habit to it:

- Strength: 20 push-ups or a short kettlebell complex
- Mindset: one page of notes from a book
- Mission: send one outbound message to advance your goal

## Where This Fits in Iron Compass

This anchor sits in [Discipline & Mindset](/domains/discipline-mindset) but stabilizes every domain. When the anchor holds, you have proof you can follow through—foundation first, complexity later.
