# The Integrity Audit: How to Spot (and Fix) the Gap Between Your Words and Your Moves

**Value promise:** A practical weekly audit that reveals where you're promising one thing and doing another—the root of broken trust and team dysfunction.

**Related semantic terms:** leadership alignment, trust erosion, personal accountability, behavioral integrity, credibility gap, values-driven leadership

## The Most Common Leadership Failure

You tell your team: "Communication is everything. I want radical transparency."

Then you don't share the bad numbers from the quarter, make a hire without asking for input, or shift priorities without a heads-up. Your team notices. They say nothing. But the trust drain starts.

You say: "Family comes first."

But you work until midnight every night, miss your son's game for a meeting that could've been an email, and don't have dinner with your partner in weeks. Your team sees it. They assume the real value—the secret priority—is the business, not family.

You claim: "We're a no-blame culture."

But when something breaks, you hunt for someone to assign fault. You ask "who messed up?" instead of "what can we learn?" Your culture isn't no-blame. It's blame-someone-else.

The gap between what you say and what you do is the root of leadership failure. Not bad strategy. Not poor execution. Broken integrity.

Most leaders don't see the gap. They're too close to themselves. That's what this audit is for.

## Why Integrity Matters More Than Skills

A leader with integrity but mediocre skills will earn team trust. A leader with brilliant skills but broken integrity will leak talent, breed cynicism, and eventually collapse.

Here's why: Your team doesn't need to understand your strategy. But they need to know what you mean. If you say "I value your input" but interrupt team members, don't ask for their opinion, or override their decisions without explanation, they hear: "I don't actually value your input."

Integrity is consistency between your words and your moves. Without it, every promise sounds like a lie.

## The Weekly Integrity Audit (20 minutes)

This is a solo exercise. Not a 360 review. Not a team survey. A hard look at yourself.

Run it every Sunday, right before you plan the week. It takes 20 minutes. You need a notebook (or a doc), honesty, and the guts to admit when you've drifted.

### Phase 1: Name Your Three Core Values (5 minutes)

Not your company values. Your personal leadership values. What you actually claim to care about.

Write three. Be specific. Not "integrity" (too abstract). But "I do what I say I'll do" (specific, measurable).

Examples:
- "I show up fully—no phone, no distraction, present with my team"
- "I handle conflict directly instead of avoiding or venting"
- "I admit mistakes faster than I assign blame"
- "I protect my team's time like it's my own"
- "I make decisions clearly and explain the reasoning"

Write three. These are your north star.

### Phase 2: Map Your Claims (3 minutes)

What do you tell people—your team, your customers, your family—about these values?

Write the claims:
- "I'm fully present with my team—meetings start on time, phones away"
- "I handle conflict directly—I'll tell you the truth, always"
- "I admit my mistakes—I don't look for blame"

Again, be specific. These are the statements that carry your credibility.

### Phase 3: Evidence Check (8 minutes)

Now the hard part. For each claim, look at your behavior this past week. Write evidence.

Ask yourself honestly:
- **Did my actions match my claims?**
- **Where did I say one thing and do another?**
- **What excuse did I use to justify the gap?**

Here's an example:

**Claim:** "I'm fully present—meetings start on time, phones away."

**Evidence:**
- Monday 9am all-hands: Started 8 minutes late. I was checking email.
- Wednesday 1pm: one-on-one with Sarah. Phone on the table. Looked at it once. Sarah said, "No rush, I know you're busy." I said, "Not at all, you have my full attention." But I'd just checked the email.
- Friday engineering standup: I was present, phone in pocket. On time. Full attention. ✓

**Gap Assessment:** 2 out of 3 meetings showed the gap between my claim ("fully present, phones away") and my behavior (late, distracted, while claiming otherwise).

**Excuse I used:** "Just quick emails, not a real distraction."

The gap: I promised full presence and explained away partial presence as acceptable.

---

### Phase 4: Pattern Recognition (3 minutes)

Look at your three values. Which one has the biggest gap between claim and behavior?

If you run this audit every week, you'll see patterns. Maybe every Monday you start late because you haven't built the boundary. Maybe every afternoon you get distracted because you lack structure. Maybe you avoid certain conversations with certain people because the conflict makes you uncomfortable.

Patterns are where the real work is. Single mistakes happen. Patterns mean the standard is broken.

### Phase 5: The Reframe (1 minute)

This is crucial: You're not here to shame yourself. You're here to choose.

You have three options for each gap:

**Option 1: Change the Value**

If you claimed to value "present, phones away" but you consistently check email in meetings, maybe the real value is "responsive and accessible." Own it. Tell your team: "I need to stay responsive during the day, so I'll check email in our meetings. It means I'm managing multiple fires. Here's how we'll handle it..."

This is honest. Your team respects honesty more than perfection.

**Option 2: Change the Behavior**

If you actually value "fully present," then commit to it. No phone. For real. Not "no phone unless urgent." Actually off. This means:
- You move the urgent meetings earlier or consolidate them
- You pick a "response window" for emails (say, 5pm)
- You tell your team: "In meetings, I'm off the phone. If there's a real emergency, call me. Otherwise, I'll respond at 5."

This is integrity. You change behavior to match your word.

**Option 3: Admit You Don't Own It Yet**

If the gap is consistent and you're not ready to change, own it: "I'm still building this muscle. I want to be fully present in meetings, and I'm not there yet. Here's what I'm working on..."

Your team will respect the admission more than a false claim.

## The Real Value of the Audit

You run this weekly, and three things happen:

**First:** You stop lying to yourself. You see the gap. You can't unsee it.

**Second:** You make a choice. Change the value, change the behavior, or admit the limit. But you choose consciously instead of drifting.

**Third:** Your team notices. Not because you talk about it, but because your behavior becomes consistent. If you claim to value directness and you actually address problems directly, they see it. If you claim to respect their input and you actually ask for it (and use it), they feel it.

## Common Gaps and Fixes

### Gap 1: "I Value Learning" But You Don't Read, Listen to Podcasts, or Discuss Ideas

**Fix (Pick One):**
- Commit to one book per month and discuss one idea from it with the team
- Listen to a podcast during your commute and share one insight
- Block 30 minutes per week to read industry news and send out one link with your take

### Gap 2: "I Hire for Culture Fit" But Your Team Is Homogeneous, Risk-Averse, and Aligned With You Too Perfectly

**Fix:**
- Audit the last three hires. What pattern do you see? Are you hiring people like you or people who complement you?
- Pick one hire (next round) based on a skill or perspective you don't have

### Gap 3: "I Lead by Example" But You Work 60-Hour Weeks and Talk About Hustle, While Your Team Burns Out

**Fix:**
- Define what "lead by example" actually means. If it's hustle and sacrifice, own it and hire people who want that. If it's sustainable excellence, then model 40–50 hours, deep focus, and clear off-time.
- Align your behavior with the culture you're claiming to build.

### Gap 4: "I Admit My Mistakes" But When You're Wrong, You Explain Why You Were Right, or You Change the Subject

**Fix:**
- Next time you're wrong, say: "I was wrong about X. Here's what I'll do differently." No explanation. No justification. Just the admission and the move.
- Your team will trust you faster if you're quick to admit mistakes than if you're never wrong.

### Gap 5: "I Trust My Team" But You Micromanage Decisions, Ask for Updates Constantly, or Override Their Work

**Fix:**
- Identify one domain where you're going to step back completely. Not "I won't check in"—"I'll check in twice a month instead of twice a day."
- Tell the person: "I'm going to trust you here. I'll check in every other Monday. If you need me earlier, reach out."
- Then actually do it.

## Using the Audit to Rebuild Trust

If you've already drifted—if your team has lost trust because of gaps between your words and moves—the audit is how you rebuild.

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Gap (In Team Meeting)

"I've been saying I value X, but my behavior hasn't matched. You've noticed. Here's where I see it: [specific gap]. That's on me. I'm changing."

### Step 2: Name the New Standard

"Going forward, here's what I'm committing to: [specific behavior]. I'll be consistent. It might take a few weeks for me to build the new muscle, but I'll get there."

### Step 3: Invite Accountability

"Tell me if I slip. I'd rather hear it from you than pretend."

Then actually listen. Don't explain or defend. Just take the feedback and adjust.

## Scaling the Audit

If you run a team of five or more, teach the audit to them. Have everyone run their own weekly integrity check. It builds culture. Everyone becomes more aware of the gap between their claims and actions. The team becomes more honest.

Then, in weekly one-on-ones, you can ask: "How'd your integrity audit go this week?" It's a low-pressure question that invites honesty about how they're showing up.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Isn't self-awareness bias an issue? Won't I just blind-spot my own gaps?**
A: Probably. That's why you add a second layer: Every month, ask one trusted person (mentor, peer, spouse) "Where do you see me saying one thing and doing another?" This isn't a 360 review. Just one person, one question. You'll be humbled. Good.

**Q: What if I run the audit and realize I don't actually care about the value I claimed?**
A: Great insight. Change it. Don't claim to value what you don't. Your team will trust you more if you're honest about what you actually prioritize than if you claim values you don't live.

**Q: How long until the gap closes?**
A: Eight to twelve weeks of consistent behavior change. Your team won't trust the shift in the first two weeks. But by week eight, they'll notice. By week twelve, they'll believe it.

**Q: What if my team is already cynical about my integrity?**
A: Start with an acknowledgment: "I've drifted. I said one thing and did another. I'm fixing it. It's going to take a few months for you to trust me again. I get it. Here's what I'm committing to..." Then follow through without broadcasting the change. Let the behavior speak.
