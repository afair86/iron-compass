## The Two-Box Model

Keep money in two mental boxes: defense (survive anything) and offense (grow over time). Know what lives in each and how to rebalance.

## Defense: Floors and Safety Nets

- 3–6 months essential expenses in high-yield cash.
- Annual deductibles and big known bills pre-funded.
- Basic estate docs: will, beneficiaries, and account access.
- Risk checks: insurance coverages, income diversity, burn rate.

## Offense: Growth and Optionality

- Automate monthly investing into broad, low-cost funds; automate increases after raises.
- Build a “bets” sleeve (5–15%) for skills, small experiments, or asymmetric upside.
- Focus on cash-flow resiliency: earning power, side offers, and network health.

## Monthly Flow (1-Hour Review)

- Pay yourself first: automate transfers to defense, then offense.
- Check burn: trailing 3-month average; if up, find the drivers.
- Rebalance: if defense &lt; target, pause offense increases until rebuilt.
- Decide one move: cut a leak, boost income, or invest in a skill.

## Recession or Income Shock Playbook

- Freeze lifestyle creep; extend runway to 6–12 months.
- Prioritize skill-building that moves income inside 30–90 days.
- Use offense sleeve for small bets that can replace income; pause new discretionary bets.

## Guardrails and Triggers

- Defense target met? Increase offense by 1–2% per raise.
- Defense &lt;3 months? Pause discretionary and rebuild immediately.
- Burn rate rising 10%+? Audit subscriptions, housing, and eating out first.

## Simple Tracking

- One monthly scorecard: runway months, savings rate, offense %, burn change, upcoming big bills.
- Use a single bank hub to route transfers; avoid scattered accounts.

## FAQ

**How much cash is enough?** Three months is a minimum; six if income is volatile.

**Should I invest lump sums or monthly?** Automate monthly and add lump sums when defense is fully funded.

**What about debt?** Pay minimums; if high-interest, prioritize paying it down before expanding offense bets.
