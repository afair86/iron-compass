## Why Purpose Stalls

Purpose is often too abstract to steer daily action. You need a simple sentence, a 12-week target, and calendar blocks that match.

## The 7-Day Sprint

- **Day 1: Inventory.** What do you protect? What problems anger you? What gives energy? Write 10 bullets each.
- **Day 2: Themes.** Cluster the inventory into 3 themes; name the “who” you serve and “why it matters.”
- **Day 3: Draft the Mission Sentence.** One line: *I build/do X for Y so that Z.*
- **Day 4: 12-Week Aim.** Pick one outcome that proves the mission is real (deliverable, revenue, body metric, relationship milestone).
- **Day 5: Block the Calendar.** Three weekly mission blocks (90–120 min) protected like revenue.
- **Day 6: Standards & No-List.** List 5 standards (what you always do) and 5 no’s (what you decline).
- **Day 7: Review & Share.** Read the sentence aloud, share with one person, and post it where you plan.

## The Mission Template

"I build/do **[work]** for **[who]** so they can **[impact]**. Over the next 12 weeks I will **[measurable proof]**."

## Blocking the Week

- **Mission Blocks (3x/week):** Deep work for the 12-week aim; no meetings.
- **Support Blocks (2x/week):** Learning, outreach, or ops that feed the mission.
- **Sweep (daily 20–30 min):** Inbox/admin; schedule tomorrow’s top 3 tied to the mission.

## Standards and No’s

- **Standards:** sleep window, daily anchor, weekly review, weekly outreach, one mission block minimum.
- **No’s:** vague collaborations, meetings without agendas, late screens before bed, side quests that don’t serve the 12-week aim.

## Review Cadence

- **Daily:** Did I hit a mission block? Top 3 done? Energy 1–5?
- **Weekly (20–30 min):** Progress toward 12-week aim; one change to schedule or scope.
- **Monthly:** Re-read mission; adjust wording only if actions contradict it.

## If You’re Multi-Passionate

Pick one primary and time-box a secondary to one block/week. No third lane until the 12-week aim ships.

## Quick Prompts

- “List the problems I’m willing to solve for a decade.”
- “What would I do if I had to deliver value in 12 weeks or lose $10k?”
- “Which people energize me? Which drain me?”

## Putting It to Work This Week

- Today: write the mission sentence and schedule three mission blocks.
- Next 3 days: begin 12-week aim; decline one misaligned request.
- Day 7: share the mission with someone who will hold you to it.
