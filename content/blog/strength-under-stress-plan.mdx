## The Problem: Training Falls Apart Under Load

When stress spikes, training is the first thing sacrificed—and the cost is higher stress, worse sleep, and softer standards. The answer is not intensity; it’s structure with built-in recovery.

## Overview: Three Phases, 12 Weeks

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Capacity & Position** — groove patterns, build work capacity, fix sleep.
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Strength & Density** — add load, control rest, keep volume sane.
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Power & Resilience** — faster reps, conditioning finishers, deload protection.

## Baseline Checks (Day 1)

- Sleep average past 7 days; fix hours before load.
- Resting HR upon waking; note for trend.
- Movement screen: squat, hinge, push, pull, carry—note pain/limits.

## Training Template (3–4 Days/Week)

- **Day A:** Squat pattern + push + carry + short conditioning.
- **Day B:** Hinge pattern + pull + core + conditioning.
- **Day C:** Single-leg/upper mix + carries + optional conditioning.
- **Day D (optional):** Conditioning/energy systems only (Zone 2 + sprints/assaults short).

## Phase 1 Details (Weeks 1–4)

- **Goal:** Perfect reps, breathe, restore sleep.
- **Main lifts:** 3–4 sets of 6–10, RPE 6–7.
- **Conditioning:** 8–12 minutes easy intervals or brisk Zone 2.
- **Rule:** Leave 2–3 reps in the tank; no grinders.
- **Sleep:** Add 45 minutes time-in-bed vs baseline.

## Phase 2 Details (Weeks 5–8)

- **Goal:** Add load; maintain form and breath.
- **Main lifts:** 4–5 sets of 4–6, RPE 7–8.
- **Accessories:** 2–3 sets of 8–12, focus on weak links.
- **Conditioning:** 10–15 minutes mixed (sleds, bike, row) post-lift.
- **Rule:** Stop one rep before form degrades.

## Phase 3 Details (Weeks 9–12)

- **Goal:** Express power; stay resilient.
- **Main lifts:** 3–4 sets of 3–5, RPE 7–8.
- **Power primers:** jumps/med-ball throws 3x3 before main lift.
- **Conditioning:** 12–16 minutes; include short sprints or assaults 10–20s with long rest.
- **Rule:** If sleep &lt;6.5h for 2 nights, pull intensity back to Phase 2 loads.

## Deloads and Auto-Regulation

- Week 4 and Week 8: drop volume by ~30–40%, keep movement patterns.
- Any week with &lt;3 sessions completed: repeat that week before advancing.

## Recovery Stack

- **Sleep:** lights-out target + room cold/dark; no caffeine after 2 pm.
- **Mobility:** 8–10 minutes post-lift on tight areas; 1–2 long walks/week.
- **Nutrition:** protein at bodyweight (g) ±10%; hydrate + electrolytes if sweating hard.

## Metrics to Track

- Sessions completed/week; RPE of main lift; resting HR trend; sleep hours; soreness 1–5.
- If resting HR up 7+ points or sleep &lt;6.5h for 2 nights, reduce load/volume for 72 hours.

## Travel/Chaotic Weeks

- Run two full-body sessions (Day A + Day B condensed): 3x6–8 per pattern, RPE 7; 8–10 min conditioning.
- Keep walks daily; protect sleep; no “making up” missed volume.

## Putting It in Motion

- Schedule 12 weeks; lock session days; prepare gym bag the night before.
- Protect one Deep block around training; phone away.
- Review weekly: progress, sleep, HR; adjust one lever.
