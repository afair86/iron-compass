## Why Purpose Feels Slippery

Purpose is not one sentence—it is a stack of direction, commitments, and daily proof. When it stays abstract, action stalls. The pipeline creates a loop: clarify → commit → execute → review → refine.

## Pipeline Overview

- **Direction:** Pick a 3–5 year aim (vivid, measurable, emotional).
- **Commitments:** 3–5 non-negotiable behaviors that prove you mean it.
- **Execution:** Weekly plans with daily hits (calendar-first, not feelings-first).
- **Review:** Weekly and monthly check-ins with a short scoreboard.
- **Refine:** Adjust inputs, not just outcomes; change one lever at a time.

## Crafting the Aim (3–5 Years)

- Write one paragraph that is specific, emotional, and measurable.
- Add constraints: what you will not do (industries, roles, schedules).
- Add stakes: why it matters to family, finances, and identity.

## Non-Negotiable Behaviors (3–5)

- Daily: 45–90 minutes on the main thing before communication channels open.
- Weekly: 1 deep work block, 1 relationship block, 1 health block.
- Guardrails: max meetings per day; bed/wake windows; device cut-off.

## Weekly Operating Rhythm

- **Plan:** Sunday 30 minutes—set 3 outcomes, schedule time for each.
- **Execute:** Start days with the hardest block; protect 90–120 minutes.
- **Reset:** Friday 20 minutes—score outcomes, log wins/blocks, set next steps.

## Daily Proof Loop

- Three wins: main task, health, relationships.
- Use a single capture list; process once daily.
- End of day: micro-journal (what worked, what to change tomorrow).

## Scoreboard (Keep It Visible)

- Outcomes hit/missed; hours on main thing; sleep hours; workouts; relationship touches.
- If you miss an outcome, adjust the input that failed: time, skill, environment.

## When Purpose Feels Foggy

- Reduce horizon to 90 days; pick 1–2 outcomes and 3 supporting behaviors.
- Remove drains: toxic commitments, low-sleep weeks, scattered tools.
- Borrow clarity: ask 2 trusted people what you do well and where to double down.

## Restart Protocol

- 72-hour reset: sleep 8 hours, hydrate, 2 walks/day, one deep work block/day.
- After 3 days, set a 2-week sprint with one outcome and daily proof.

## FAQ

**What if I don’t know my 3–5 year aim?** Start with 90 days and a small bet; refine monthly.

**How do I stay consistent?** Calendar the blocks first, keep a visible scoreboard, and review weekly.

**What if I miss weeks?** Run a 72-hour reset, then a 2-week sprint with one outcome and daily proof.
