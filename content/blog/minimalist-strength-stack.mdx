## Why Minimal Beats Maximal

Complex programs die when life gets chaotic. Three lifts and two carries cover almost every pattern, keep recovery predictable, and allow year-round consistency. A single engine protocol gives you aerobic base and a lever for short intervals without wrecking recovery.

## The Core Movements

- Squat pattern: front squat or split squat.
- Hinge pattern: deadlift or RDL.
- Press pattern: overhead or floor press paired with rows.
- Carries: farmer (both hands) and suitcase (single-hand anti-tilt).
- Engine: Zone 2 base with brief intervals.

## Weekly Template (3 Days)

### Day A (Squat Emphasis)
- Front squat 4x6–8 (RPE 7)
- Overhead or floor press 4x6–8
- Farmer carry 4x40–60m
- 10 minutes Zone 2 walk/bike

### Day B (Hinge Emphasis)
- RDL or deadlift 4x5–6 (RPE 7–8)
- Row or pull variation 4x8–10
- Suitcase carry 4x30–50m/side
- Core: plank 3x45s or anti-rotation holds

### Day C (Mixed + Engine)
- Split squat 3x8–10
- Floor press 3x8
- Chin/pull 3x6–8
- Farmer or suitcase carry 3x40m
- 12–15 minutes intervals: 10–20s hard / 60–90s easy

## Progression Model

- Weeks 1–3: Volume focus (3–4x8–10, RPE 6–7).
- Weeks 4–6: Load focus (4–5x5–8, RPE 7–8).
- Weeks 7–9: Density focus (hold load, trim rest by 10–15s weekly if form holds).
- Week 10: Deload (volume -30–40%, keep patterns).
- Repeat the cycle; add load only when reps/tempo/rest are solid.

## Engine Protocols

- Zone 2: 20–30 minutes 1–2x/week; nasal, conversational pace.
- Intervals: 10–20s hard / 60–90s easy, 8–12 rounds; stop when power drops.
- If sleep &lt;6.5h or RHR +7, skip intervals and keep only Zone 2.

## Recovery & Metrics

- Sleep 7–9 hours; protein at bodyweight (g) ±10%; hydration.
- Track: sessions/week, top-set RPE, rest times, RHR trend, sleep hours.
- If RHR rises 7+ or sleep is low twice, reduce load 10–15% and drop one interval day.

## Putting It Into Play

- Schedule three days; never miss twice.
- Pre-stage weights and timer; carries outdoors if possible.
- Keep a single-page log; progress one lever per week (reps, load, rest).

## FAQ

**Can I run this with dumbbells only?** Yes—use goblet/front rack for squats, DB RDLs, DB presses, and carries.

**What if my grip fails?** Use chalk; alternate hands; straps only on hinge day if needed; keep suitcase carries strap-free.

**How long are sessions?** 45–60 minutes including the engine block.
