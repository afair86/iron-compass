## Why Discipline Cracks Under Noise

Discipline fails when every day requires fresh decisions. The relay removes choice: fixed wake and lights-out, a daily anchor, a three-block day, and a weekly review. You make the rules once, then execute them for four weeks.

## Relay Overview (4 Weeks)

- **Week 1 — Anchors & Bookends:** lock wake/lights-out, add a 20-minute anchor.
- **Week 2 — Three-Block Day:** deep / build / sweep with binary compliance.
- **Week 3 — Environment Design:** remove friction for good choices, add friction for distractions.
- **Week 4 — Review & Load:** measure compliance, adjust one lever, add a second Deep only if ready.

## Standards for the Entire Relay

- Wake within a 30-minute band; lights-out within the same band.
- One Deep block every day, two only after 80% compliance.
- Daily anchor never skipped; if time slips, run it before sleep.
- Weekly review: one change per week, no stack of tweaks.

## Week 1: Anchors & Bookends

- **Wake/Lights-out:** treat them like flights. Prep clothes, water, and workspace the night before.
- **20-minute anchor:**
  - 5 min breath/posture reset (box breathing, shoulders back).
  - 10 min skill reps on your main lever (writing, outreach, code, study).
  - 5 min micro-review (what improved, one tweak tomorrow).
- **Compliance grid:** date, wake yes/no, lights-out yes/no, anchor yes/no, Deep yes/no, energy 1–5.

## Week 2: Three-Block Day

- **Deep (60–120 min):** mission-critical work; phone out of room; single-tab rule.
- **Build (45–90 min):** assets and systems—templates, SOPs, pipelines.
- **Sweep (30–60 min):** admin, inbox, logistics; end with tomorrow’s top three.
- Protect Deep earlier in the day. If only one Deep is possible, make it count.

## Week 3: Environment Design

- **Remove friction for good:** gear prepped, single-task list visible, calendar invites off during Deep.
- **Add friction for distraction:** focus mode; hide social apps; block sites during Deep.
- **Arena ready:** headphones, water, scratch pad; no searching for tools mid-block.

## Week 4: Review & Load

- **Metrics:** compliance %, average energy, missed anchors, missed Deep.
- **Root causes:** sleep debt, over-scheduling, environment leaks.
- **Adjust one lever:** shorter Deep, earlier Deep, tighter bedtime, or reduce meetings.
- **Add second Deep only if:** 80%+ compliance on week 3 and energy ≥3 most days.

## Scripts & Prompts

- **Morning alignment:** “Remind me of my 3 standards, today’s single win, and my blocks. Ask me to commit in one sentence.”
- **Task breakdown:** “Turn this outcome into 3 blocks with start/finish definitions and ‘done’ criteria.”
- **Evening debrief:** “List wins/misses and one system change for tomorrow. Did I protect my standards?”

## Troubleshooting

- **Low energy:** fix sleep first; shorten Deep to 45–60 minutes; keep the slot.
- **Missed anchor:** run a 10-minute version before bed; no zero days.
- **Too many meetings:** move Deep to mornings; sweep handles meetings/admin after.

## Putting It Into This Week

- Today: set wake/lights-out, place anchor, schedule one Deep daily.
- Days 2–7: run the grid; remove one distraction; keep anchor at all costs.
- End of week: adjust one lever; repeat for week 2 with blocks.

## FAQ

**How long to see results?** Most men see better compliance within 7–10 days.

**What if I miss a day?** Shrink scope (shorter Deep, 10-minute anchor) but keep the time slots.

**Do I need two Deep blocks?** Start with one; add a second only after 80% compliance and steady energy.
