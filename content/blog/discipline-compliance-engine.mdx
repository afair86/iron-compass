## Why Most Discipline Plans Fail

Most “discipline” plans collapse under stress because they rely on motivation, pile on complexity, ignore sleep, and track too many variables. Compliance drops, recovery tanks, and the plan becomes another failure loop. The fix is a small set of non-negotiable anchors, binary scoring, and a recovery floor that protects sleep and health.

## The Compliance Engine (12 Weeks)

### Week 0: Baseline and Constraints

- Log a 7-day baseline: wake/bed windows, sleep hours, caffeine, alcohol, and current habit compliance.
- Define red lines: no screens after 10pm, no >2 drinks/night, minimum 7h time-in-bed.
- Pick one keystone habit with a time anchor (e.g., after coffee, before opening comms).
- Set up a 5-minute nightly audit: win, block, adjust tomorrow.

### Weeks 1–4: Single Anchor + One Keystone

- Run one keystone daily; treat it as binary (done/not done).
- Keep a 10-minute morning setup: water, light, plan the hard block.
- Nightly audit: record compliance and one blocker; adjust environment (stage clothes, prep desk).
- Aim for 80%+ compliance before adding another lever.

### Weeks 5–8: Second Keystone + Weekly Review

- Add a health block (walk or lift) 3–4x/week; keep it calendar-first.
- Sunday plan (30 minutes): set three outcomes, schedule deep blocks, schedule health blocks.
- Friday review (20 minutes): score outcomes, pick one adjustment (time, skill, or environment).
- Keep communications off until the day’s hard block is done.

### Weeks 9–12: Skill Block + Environment Tightening

- Add a 45–90 minute skill/deep work block 4x/week.
- Remove friction: pre-stage gear, meals, and calendar invites with yourself.
- Add social proof: share weekly score with a peer; small public commitments increase follow-through.
- Keep deload weeks: drop volume of optional tasks by ~30% every 4th week.

## Daily Architecture

- Wake and sleep within a 60-minute window.
- One hard block before communication channels; one health block; one relationship touch (call/text/date).
- End-of-day 5-minute audit: what worked, what to change.
- Hydration, protein, and light movement to keep energy stable.

## Weekly Operating Rhythm

- **Sunday Plan (30m):** set three outcomes, schedule blocks, identify one foreseeable blocker.
- **Midweek Check (10m):** remove one blocker; keep anchors intact.
- **Friday Review (20m):** score outcomes, choose a single lever to adjust next week.

## Stress-Test & Recovery Floors

- Red: sleep &lt;6.5h → no intensity; walk + protein first; keep anchors only.
- Yellow: compressed day → anchors only (hard block + health block scaled down).
- Green: full day → run all blocks.

## Metrics to Track

- Compliance % per keystone (binary).
- Sleep hours and resting HR trend.
- Missed-day recovery time: how fast you resume after a miss.
- Weekly outcomes hit rate.

## Putting It Into Play

- Calendar all anchors; alarms mark starts, not just wakes.
- Pre-stage to kill friction: clothes, water, work surface, playlist.
- Share weekly score with one peer; celebrate streaks, not hours.

## FAQ

**How many keystones should I run?** Start with one for 2–4 weeks; add a second only after 80%+ compliance.

**What if I miss days?** Run a 72-hour reset: sleep 8h, one walk/day, one hard block/day; then resume full anchors.

**How do I avoid burnout?** Guard sleep, keep anchors small, and change one lever at a time—usually time, environment, or skill.
