## The Noise Problem

Small teams drown in status sprawl, unclear priorities, and slow decisions. Signal-first leadership strips noise, clarifies the top 3–5 priorities, and makes decisions fast while keeping trust high.

## Weekly Signal Cadence

- **Kickoff (30–40m):** last week’s scores; this week’s 3–5 outcomes; owners and definitions of done; dependencies.
- **Daily Check (10–12m):** yesterday, today, blocker; no solving—just capture.
- **Midweek Pulse (20–30m):** resolve blockers, trade priorities, confirm the top 3 still holds.
- **Weekly Review (30–40m):** score outcomes, log decisions, capture one improvement.

## Artifacts That Matter

- Weekly doc: priorities, owners, definitions of done.
- Decision log: date, owner, rationale to prevent re-litigating.
- Risk list: top 3 risks, owners, check dates.

## Communication Rules

- Default async updates; meetings for decisions and unblockers.
- Owners speak first; managers last.
- Park anything needing >5 minutes for a separate, time-boxed slot.

## Trust & Feedback

- Micro-feedback weekly: one keep, one improve.
- Leaders share a miss + fix publicly; credit wins openly, coach privately.

## Metrics to Watch

- Outcome hit rate.
- Decision latency (request → decision).
- Blocker resolution time.
- Deep work blocks protected per person.

## Putting It Into Play

- Stand up the weekly doc; template it for repeat use.
- Run the cadence for two weeks before adding tools or automation.
- Review metrics monthly; adjust one rule at a time.

## FAQ

**How do I stop meeting creep?** Keep one weekly doc, strict agendas, and move long debates to a separate time-boxed slot.

**What if priorities change midweek?** Use the pulse to swap intentionally, update the doc, and communicate the change async.

**How do I build trust fast?** Keep small promises visible, give weekly micro-feedback, and celebrate wins publicly while coaching privately.
