## Why Leaders Freeze

Stress narrows focus, distorts time, and pushes reactive choices. A short, repeatable protocol protects speed and clarity.

## The 30-Minute Protocol (OODA Simplified)

- **0–5 min: Orient.** What happened? What’s the objective? Who’s at risk? Stop scope creep.
- **5–10 min: Options.** Generate 2–3 viable actions with pros/cons. Avoid perfect—pick workable.
- **10–20 min: Decide & Assign.** Choose one path; assign owners, start/finish times, and check-in.
- **20–30 min: Communicate.** Broadcast the plan, owners, and when updates arrive. Remove ambiguity.

## Guardrails for High-Pressure Calls

- **One objective only.** Prevent goal drift.
- **Time box debate.** No endless pros/cons; choose and move.
- **Default to reversible actions** first if impact is similar.
- **Pre-authorize triggers.** If X happens, we do Y without waiting.

## Templates You Can Use

- **Situation:** “We are facing [issue]. Objective is [single goal]. Time to act: [minutes].”
- **Options:** “Option A (pro/con), Option B (pro/con), Option C (pro/con).”
- **Decision:** “We pick [option]. Owner: [name]. Start/finish: [time]. Check-in: [time].”
- **Broadcast:** “Plan: [one line]. Owners: [names]. Next update: [time]. Signals to escalate: [conditions].”

## Red-Team in Five Minutes

Grab one peer to poke holes:
- What’s the biggest risk of this plan?
- What assumption could be wrong?
- What if we’re 30 minutes late—what fails?

## Communication Cadence

- **Initial broadcast:** plan + owners + timing.
- **Midpoint update:** “On track/off track; blockers; adjustments.”
- **Close-out:** what finished; next steps; who owns follow-through.

## After-Action (10–15 Minutes)

- What did we decide and why? Outcome vs expectation.
- What signals did we miss? What do we pre-authorize next time?
- One process change: checklist, trigger, or owner shift.

## Training the Team

- Run monthly drills on likely failures (service outage, supply hit, team illness).
- Create a one-page protocol accessible to all; laminate or pin in chat.
- Rotate who leads drills to grow depth.

## When to Slow Down

- Irreversible decisions with high blast radius.
- When data is cheap and fast to get (wait 10–15 minutes if it halves risk).

## Putting It in Play This Week

- Draft your protocol doc; set escalation triggers.
- Run one 20-minute drill with your team; rotate lead.
- Add midpoint/close-out updates to your comms standard.
