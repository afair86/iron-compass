## Why Legacy Feels Distant

Legacy drifts into the future when values are abstract, constraints are absent, and proof is invisible. We tell ourselves “later” while the days fill with random obligations. The antidote is present-tense identity design: translate values into weekly commitments, create artifacts and spaces that signal who you are, and run a tight review loop so you adapt without losing the thread.

## The Identity Design Loop (Repeat Weekly)

Values → Constraints → Commitments → Artifacts → Review → Adjust one lever.

- **Values:** What you claim matters.
- **Constraints:** What you will not do (time, money, attention, relationships).
- **Commitments:** Weekly behaviors that prove the values.
- **Artifacts:** Visible signals—documents, spaces, routines, language.
- **Review:** Keep what works, prune what doesn’t.

## Values to Behaviors (Concrete Translation)

Pick **three values**. For each, define two behaviors and one constraint.

Example:
- **Courage:** One hard conversation/week; one visible decision log entry. **Constraint:** No ghosting—respond within 24 hours.
- **Service:** One help delivered/week; one gratitude note/week. **Constraint:** Limit meetings to those that serve the mission.
- **Craft:** Two 90-minute deep work blocks/week; one publish/ship/week. **Constraint:** Max 2 social scroll windows/day.

Make each behavior binary (done/not done). Avoid vague goals (“be present”); replace with actions (“one phone-off dinner”).

## Constraints: The Guardrails That Protect Identity

Identity fails without guardrails. Define three to five constraints:
- **Time:** Earliest meeting 10am; no meetings after 5pm twice/week; one meeting-free day if possible.
- **Attention:** No notifications during deep work; phone parked outside bedroom; social limited to two windows/day.
- **Money:** Spending caps on low-value categories; auto-transfer to priorities.
- **Relationships:** No venting without a proposed fix; no gossip about absent people.
- **Health:** Sleep window; minimum walks; alcohol cap.

Constraints free you to live the values by removing endless negotiation.

## Artifacts & Signals (Make Identity Visible)

Create simple artifacts that remind you and inform others:
- **Creed:** A short paragraph of who you are and what you keep sacred; read weekly.
- **Decision log:** Date, decision, rationale, expected outcome; review monthly.
- **Service log:** Who you helped, how, and why; keeps service visible.
- **Space:** A clean desk, a single board with 3 weekly outcomes, a printed creed.
- **Language:** Phrases you use intentionally (“What outcome matters?”, “What would good look like?”).
- **Relationship artifacts:** Weekly gratitude note; monthly teach/share session.

Keep artifacts small and durable. If an artifact doesn’t change your behavior, prune or redesign it.

## Weekly Cadence (Operational Rhythm)

- **Sunday Plan (20–30m):**
  - Choose three outcomes tied to your values (one health, one relationship, one work/craft).
  - Schedule deep work blocks; place constraints on the calendar (meeting caps, phone-off windows).
  - Pick one service action and one gratitude note.
- **Daily:**
  - Run one hard block (craft) and one relationship touch (call/text/dinner).
  - Observe constraints (notifications off, meeting caps).
  - Quick check: did I live the creed today? What broke a constraint?
- **Friday Review (20m):**
  - Score behaviors (binary). Note where constraints failed. Adjust one lever.
  - Update decision log with outcomes; capture one lesson.

## Proof & Feedback Loops

- **Metrics:** Compliance per behavior; constraint breaks/week; deep work hours; relationship touches; sleep hours.
- **External mirrors:** Ask two trusted people monthly: “Where did I show this value? Where did I miss?”
- **Pruning:** Drop or redesign behaviors that don’t move the value; add only when compliance is 80%+ for 3+ weeks.

## Identity in Relationships

- **Signals to others:** Share your meeting caps, focus hours, and preferred channels. Use auto-replies during deep work.
- **Energy matching:** Spend more time with those who respect your constraints and values; limit time with those who erode them.
- **Hard conversations:** Script the opener: “I care about us and this matters. Here’s what I’m seeing. Can we fix it?”

## Work, Money, and Legacy

- Align work with your creed: if a task doesn’t serve a value, minimize or delegate it.
- Money as a signal: auto-transfer to causes that reflect your values; cap spending that contradicts them.
- Track impact: monthly summary of shipped work, people helped, and lessons learned.

## Resets and Relapse Plan

If you drift:
- **72-hour reset:** Sleep window, daily walk, one deep work block, one gratitude note, constraints back on.
- **Clutter purge:** Reset your space; remove digital noise (close tabs, archive inbox to zero). 
- **Constraint audit:** Which guardrail broke? Reinstate or simplify it.

## Scripts and Prompts

- **Creed starter:** “I am a man who _____. I keep ___ sacred. I choose ___ and I refuse ___.”
- **Gratitude note:** “I appreciate you for ___. It mattered because ___. Thank you.”
- **Service ask:** “How can I remove one obstacle for you this week?”
- **Decision log entry:** “Today I decided __ because __. Expected outcome __ by __ date.”

## Putting It Into Play (Day 1 Checklist)

1) Pick 3 values and write 2 behaviors + 1 constraint for each.
2) Draft a 3–4 line creed; print or pin it.
3) Create a one-page board: 3 weekly outcomes, constraints listed, space for a service/gratitude line.
4) Schedule two deep work blocks and one relationship touch for this week.
5) Start a decision log (date, decision, rationale, expected outcome).

## After 4–6 Weeks

- Review which behaviors actually changed your days; prune the rest.
- If compliance is high, add one new behavior or strengthen a constraint (e.g., stricter meeting caps).
- Share your creed and constraints with one trusted person; ask them to reflect what they see.
- Consider one public artifact (a monthly thread/post/letter) if it reinforces the value—optional, not required.

## FAQ

**How many values should I run?** Three is plenty. More dilutes focus and reduces compliance.

**What if I miss weeks?** Run a 72-hour reset: sleep window, daily walk, deep work block, gratitude note, constraints on.

**How do I avoid performative legacy?** Keep proof private first; share only what serves others. Artifacts are for alignment, not applause.

**When do I change values?** Review quarterly. Keep what you actually live; drop what stays theoretical.

**How do I know it’s working?** Higher compliance, fewer constraint breaks, clearer decisions, and feedback from trusted people aligning with your creed.
