# Build Your Personal Doctrine in 7 Days

**Value promise:** A fast, structured sprint to define the principles and filters that steer every major decision you make.

- **Related semantic terms:** principles stack, values to behaviors, time allocation

A doctrine is a compact set of principles, behaviors, and policies that decide for you when you are tired or pressured. Instead of improvising every day, you pre-commit to what you say yes to, what you decline, how you spend time, and how you respond to conflict. In seven days you will write, test, and publish a doctrine you can use immediately. This sprint assumes you have a busy life; each day’s work fits in 45–60 minutes.

## Day 1 — Inventory Reality

Purpose stalls when you work from fantasy. Start with the constraints and obligations you actually have.

- List your roles (partner, parent, leader, builder, son, friend). For each, write the minimum standard you will keep even on bad weeks.
- List obligations (fixed meetings, commute, care duties). Mark the truly fixed items.
- List constraints (health, finances, geography, legal). Write them plainly; constraints help creativity.
- List energy sources and drains. Note the environments and people that change your state.

Outcome: one page describing the ground truth of your life. Keep it visible all week.

## Day 2 — Name First Principles

Principles are the non-negotiable statements that define how you operate. Keep them short and testable.

- Draft 5–7 candidate principles. Examples: "Build trust through clarity and follow-through," "Protect deep work before collaboration," "Family dinners are sacred," "Tell the truth fast, even when costly."
- For each principle, write one **proof behavior** (how it shows up) and one **violation** (what it forbids).
- Stress-test: imagine a stressful Tuesday. Does the principle help you decide? If not, sharpen it.

Outcome: 3–5 final principles with proof behaviors and violations. Post them where you plan (desk, phone lock screen).

## Day 3 — Time and Attention Policy

Your calendar is your doctrine in motion. Build a policy that allocates time to what you claim matters.

- Define your weekly time budget: hours for mission work, hours for health, hours for family, hours for admin.
- Create three recurring **mission blocks** tied to your current 12-week aim. Treat them like revenue appointments.
- Establish **no-fly zones**: times you do not take meetings (e.g., first 3 hours of the day), apps you avoid during mission blocks, and contexts you reject (meetings without agendas).
- Set an **input diet**: news, social, and chat windows. Decide when and for how long you consume them.

## Day 4 — Relationships and Boundaries

Doctrine fails if you cannot defend it. Boundaries are the guardrails that keep your principles from being negotiated away.

- Map relationships into red/amber/green. Red = extractive, Amber = mixed, Green = supportive. Allocate time accordingly.
- Write boundary scripts for common situations: declining a meeting, renegotiating a deadline, saying no to a trip.
- Decide your **conflict posture**: direct but calm; write first, talk second; wait 24 hours before responding when angry.
- Choose one accountability partner to review your doctrine and call you out when you drift.

Outcome: two scripts you can use this week and one person who will hold you to the doctrine.

## Day 5 — Money Rules

Money rules translate values into spending, saving, and investing behavior.

- Decide your **runway floor** (months of expenses you will protect). Connect to [domains/financial-power](domains/financial-power).
- Set allocation targets: what percentage to investments, debt paydown, and skill-building.
- Create **purchase rules**: cooling-off periods, dollar thresholds that require a 24-hour pause, and a list of always-yes (tools that save time, health essentials).
- Define **earning moves** aligned to doctrine: consulting boundaries, project criteria, and red-line industries you avoid.

Outcome: a one-page money policy that prevents impulse decisions and aligns with your mission.

## Day 6 — Health and Capacity

Capacity sustains doctrine. Without sleep and strength, principles decay into wishes.

- Define your **sleep window** and set guardrails (screens off, lights dim, room cool).
- Pick a **minimum weekly movement standard**: 3 strength sessions + 2 Zone 2 walks, or equivalent. Link to [domains/strength](domains/strength).
- Create a **stress bleed-off** ritual for high-pressure days (10-minute walk + 4-7-8 breathing + body scan).
- Choose one **keystone habit** that anchors the day (morning sunlight, daily anchor block, or evening shutdown).

Outcome: a simple capacity plan that keeps your nervous system online so you can keep promises.

## Day 7 — Doctrine to Action

A doctrine that lives in a drawer is dead. Publish it and run it for 30 days.

- Write the doctrine in one page: principles with proof behaviors, time policy, money rules, health standards, and boundary scripts.
- Share with your accountability partner. Invite them to ask weekly if you are following it.
- Add visible reminders: desktop wallpaper with principles, a printed card in your wallet, calendar holds for mission blocks.
- Set review cadences: weekly 20-minute review, monthly 60-minute audit, quarterly deep rewrite if needed.

Outcome: a public, portable doctrine you can use to answer every request with yes/no/renegotiate.

## Sample One-Page Doctrine (Template)

**Principles (with proofs):**
- Clarity beats speed. Proof: every task has owner/date. Violation: starting work without definition of done.
- Family dinners matter. Proof: four dinners/week device-free. Violation: accepting meetings during that window.
- Deep work fuels output. Proof: three 90-minute mission blocks scheduled first. Violation: trading mission time for admin.
- Truth fast. Proof: respond with facts within 24 hours even when uncomfortable. Violation: letting issues simmer.

**Time policy:** mornings reserved for mission; meetings 1–4 p.m. only; Fridays protected for review and planning.

**Money rules:** 20% to runway, 20% to investments, 10% to skill; $500+ purchases require 24-hour pause.

**Health:** asleep by 10:30 p.m., 3 strength + 2 Zone 2 weekly, no caffeine after 1 p.m.

**Boundaries:** no agenda, no meeting; no reactive Slack in Deep Work; say no to misaligned projects, offer referral instead.

Print, sign, and date it. Review monthly.

## Decision Trees You Can Use Immediately

**Incoming request:**
1) Does this advance my 12-week aim? If no, decline or defer.
2) Does it violate a principle (time, money, health)? If yes, decline or renegotiate scope.
3) If yes to both above, where does it fit in the calendar without displacing mission blocks? If it displaces, it is a no.

**Opportunity with money upside but time cost:**
1) Run through money rules: does it hit red-line industries? Does it extend runway? Does it block mission time?
2) If upside is speculative, cap time investment and set a decision checkpoint.
3) If accepted, schedule support blocks; do not cannibalize health.

## Calendar and Review Examples

- **Weekly planning (Sunday, 30 minutes):** place mission blocks first, then health, then deep relationships. Only after that do you accept meetings. Add two boundary scripts you will use this week.
- **Daily startup (10 minutes):** read doctrine, confirm top three aligned tasks, place them on the calendar. Adjust if emergencies came in overnight.
- **Weekly review (30 minutes):** score compliance (mission blocks hit, sleep window, money rule adherence). Note one doctrine win and one drift. Choose one fix.
- **Quarterly audit (60 minutes):** do the doctrine still match reality? Remove anything unused. Add new constraints or principles if life changed.

## Writing Doctrine for Different Roles

- **Founder:** heavier focus on money rules, hiring bar, and decision velocity. Include fundraising boundaries and customer fit criteria.
- **Manager:** emphasize cadence, meeting hygiene, and coaching commitments. Add a rule for protecting team focus hours.
- **Parent:** build in family rituals, energy management, and co-parenting agreements. Add response rules for kid emergencies.
- **Student:** prioritize study blocks, sleep, and debt rules. Limit social inputs and define exam-period protocols.

## Common Pushbacks and Counters

- "I cannot be this rigid." — Doctrine reduces decision fatigue so you can be flexible where it matters. Try it for 30 days, then loosen if desired.
- "My boss will not respect this." — Share the mission blocks and explain the benefit to output. Offer visibility and fast updates in return for protected time.
- "My partner thinks it is controlling." — Co-design shared sections; keep personal standards that improve the household. Invite feedback after two weeks.

## If You Fall Off

Do a 72-hour reset:
- Day 1: sleep window + one mission block + one boundary script used.
- Day 2: repeat, add one money rule check.
- Day 3: add a mini review and rewrite one proof behavior that failed.
Then resume normal cadence. Doctrine is a compass, not a cage.

## How to Use the Doctrine Daily

- Start each week by scheduling mission blocks first, then everything else.
- When a request arrives, run it through the doctrine: Does it violate a principle? Does it fit the time budget? Does it advance the 12-week aim?
- When you feel pulled in five directions, reread the proof behaviors. Pick the one that applies and act.
- When you drift, return to the minimum viable behaviors (sleep window, mission block, boundary scripts).

## Troubleshooting

- **Principles too vague:** add proof behaviors and violations. If you cannot imagine saying no with them, they are slogans, not principles.
- **Calendar keeps getting invaded:** make holds visible and non-negotiable; create shared calendars with family or team; install meeting booking rules.
- **Guilt about saying no:** script responses; remind yourself of the mission; offer an alternative that fits your doctrine.
- **Over-complexity:** if the doctrine takes more than one page, prune it. Simplicity wins under stress.
- **Partner pushback:** invite them to co-create the parts that affect them (sleep window, budget). Doctrine should serve the household, not just you.

## Examples of Personal Doctrine Lines

- "I build trust with clarity and follow-through; I do not accept vague work." Proof: every task has an owner and deadline; violation: I leave meetings without decisions.
- "Family dinners are sacred four nights a week." Proof: phone in another room; violation: scheduling calls at dinner time.
- "I protect 3 mission blocks weekly." Proof: calendar holds and door sign; violation: trading mission time for admin.
- "Health first on red days." Proof: cut volume, keep movement; violation: adding caffeine instead of sleep.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: What if my doctrine conflicts with my job?**
Use it to negotiate scope or plan an exit runway. Doctrine is your north star; if work repeatedly violates it, you need a timeline to change roles or environments.

**Q2: How detailed should principles be?**
Short enough to memorize, concrete enough to act on. Pair each with a "do" and a "do not" example so it survives stress.

**Q3: How often should I update it?**
Quarterly light edits and an annual deep review. If you change jobs, cities, or family status, run a fresh 7-day sprint.

**Q4: Can I share this with my team?**
Yes. Trim personal sections and keep decision filters. Team doctrines improve alignment and reduce friction.

**Q5: What if my partner disagrees with parts of it?**
Co-create shared sections (sleep, budget, childcare). Keep personal standards that do not harm the household. Negotiate, do not dictate.

**Q6: How do I know it is working?**
You decline faster, your calendar matches your aim, and you feel less resentment. Track weekly: percent of mission blocks completed, number of unplanned commitments added, and sleep compliance.
