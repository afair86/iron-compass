        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Discipline is the backbone of a complete life system. Without it, even the best intentions and plans fall apart. For men who want to rise beyond limits, discipline is not just a trait—it’s the daily practice that supports every other domain: strength, purpose, leadership, financial power, and even the intelligent use of AI. Mindset and discipline work together to create the structure and control needed to build a life of meaning and progress.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Why Discipline Matters More Than Motivation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300">
          Motivation is unreliable. It comes and goes, often fading when you need it most. Discipline, on the other hand, is a choice you make every day—regardless of how you feel. Men who rely on motivation find themselves stuck in cycles of inconsistency. Those who build real discipline create a stable foundation for progress, no matter the circumstances.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300">
          Building discipline means showing up, doing the work, and keeping promises to yourself. It’s about taking control of your actions and mindset, even when comfort or distraction calls. This is how to build discipline that lasts.
